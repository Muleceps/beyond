# The Cleric

You have all the Adventurer Moves and Deity.

Choose three class moves to start with from among your themes. Your themes are
[Caster](#--caster), [Protector](#--protector), and [Prophet](#--prophet). You
must take the first move in each theme before taking any below it. Indicate
your move by marking it (put an x: (x) to show you have the move).

When you roll a 6-, mark one of the advancement boxes [ ] below the move you
rolled by adding an x (like this: [x]). When all the advancement boxes for an
ability are filled in you gain that ability. You may fill advancement boxes in
any order you like.

When you take a condition (when a move says to or when the GM says to) fill in
any condition box < > for any move. That condition applies until a move or the
GM tells you to remove a condition.

with it and roll+0. On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t

You serve and worship some deity or power which grants you spells. Give your
god a name (maybe Helferth, Sucellus, Zorica or Krugon the Bleak) and choose
your deity’s domain:

* Healing and Restoration
* The Night Sky And Prophetic Stars
* Knowledge and Hidden Things

#### ( ) Turn Undead

When you hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for protection,
roll+2. On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray and brandish your holy symbol,
no undead may come within reach of you. On a 10+, you also momentarily daze
intelligent undead and cause mindless undead to flee. Aggression breaks the
effects and they are able to act as normal. Intelligent undead may still find
ways to harry you from afar. They’re clever like that.

**Abilities**

* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Banish Undead: You also deal your damage to all undead
  present on a 7+.
* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Sanctify: On a 7+ the ground you stand on up to 10
  paces from you is sanctified making it anathema to undead. The effects of
  your turning are permanent on that ground.

**Conditions**

* < > Marked By Death: The undead and spirits are drawn to you for revenge or
  salvation.

### ( ) Protector

When you petition your deity according to the precept of your religion you get
1 hold and lose any hold you already had. Spend that hold when you or an ally
takes damage to call on your deity, they intervene with an appropriate
manifestation (a sudden gust of wind, a lucky slip, a burst of light) and
negate the damage.

#### ( ) The Scales of Life And Death

When you tend to someone who would take their last breath, they do not take
their last breath as long as you do nothing but care for them. They are
incapacitated, but will not die so long as you tend to them.

#### ( ) Divine Protection

When you have time and safety with a magic item you may ask the GM what it
does, the GM will answer you truthfully.
