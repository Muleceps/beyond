# The GM

The GM is responsible for everything outside of the player characters. The
players say what their characters say, think, and do. The GM says everything
else.

## Starting The Game

The GM begins the game with a starting goal for the players. This is basically
a pitch for what the first session will be. Sharing the starting goal ahead of
sitting down to play gives everyone time to consider and buy in to the goal,
but if need be you can just sit down to play and pitch a goal then. More on
goals, adversaries, and how to make them comes later in this section but here
are some ready-to-go starting goals:

* Retrieve a mysteriously disappeared wizard's belongings from his infested
  tower and return them to his family.
* Recover the local relics from a community temple that collapsed into an
  unknown creature's den below it.
* Track and drive off an expedition of demons that are scouting the area for
  materials and souls to harvest.

Starting goals (or all goals for that matter) don't have to be complex or
creative. What seems direct and obvious to one person may be unexpected to
others. And even the simplest goal may be complicated the moment the dice hit
the table.

## GM Moves

GM moves are ways for you to move the action forward. When someone looks at you
to see what happens you make a **GM move**. When the players roll a 6- on a
move or give you a golden opportunity by putting themselves in danger you make
a **hard GM move.**

Each GM move describes some change that moves the world along and sets up more
action. Hard GM moves are just GM moves made in a way that offers little or no
chance for reaction or mitigation.

For now the set of GM moves is unchanged from DW, but I intend to revisit this:

* Use an NPC, force, or adventure location move
* Reveal an unwelcome truth
* Show signs of an approaching threat
* Deal damage
* Use up their resources
* Turn their move back on them
* Separate them
* Give an opportunity that fits a class’ abilities
* Show a downside to their class, form, or gear
* Offer an opportunity, with or without cost
* Put someone in a spot
* Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask

## NPCs

Non-player characters do not use the classes or dice like player characters do.
They do not have player moves that require rolling dice, but they do have HP,
armor, and damage.

Each NPC is described by a die size, an allegiance, an instinct, and one or
more GM moves. Some NPCs may also have special rules.

The die size indicates the combat ability of the NPC here and now. It can
change moment to moment as a spell invigorates or a weapon is lost. HP, armor,
and damage are derived from the die size:

* The NPCs damage is their die
* The NPCs maximum HP is equal to their die size
* The NPCs armor is equal to their die size, divided by 4 (rounded down)

If an NPC's die size changes their HP changes with it. If they were at maximum
HP before the change their HP becomes the maximum for the new die size. If they
were below maximum and their die size decreased such that their HP is now over
maximum it goes to their new maximum. Otherwise their current HP does not
change.

An NPC's allegiance indicates what or who it serves. When making long-term
plans for an NPC, use its allegiance as guidance. When playing an NPC that is
seeking help or support, look to their allegiance.

An NPC's instinct indicates what goal it pursues in the moment. When looking
for what an NPC will do right here and now use its instinct.

An NPC's GM moves describe any specific ways that it will act out its instinct
or serve its allegiance. Think of them as specific phrasings of GM moves.
"Ensnare them in vines" is a more specific version of "put them in a spot", for
example. Having specific moves for an NPC gives you ways to describe that NPC
and their particular skills and abilities.

Some NPCs also have special rules. NPCs don't make player moves, but they may
modify player moves or modify how damage, armor, or other rules work. For
example, lantern goblins have this special rule: "When a lantern goblin is
destroyed it's flame immediately flies to another lantern goblin if one is
present. That lantern goblin increases its die size."

Non-player characters include any living thing that is not a player character.
Beasts, humanoids, and stranger creatures all use these rules.

## Forces

**Forces** are the entities and groups that act on the world around the player
characters. They can be large scale, like a kingdom or religious order, or
local, like a sheriff or communal farm. Forces act on the world to create
problems and opportunities for the player characters.

There is no set list of forces. It is up to the GM to identify forces as they
come up and add them to their tracking sheet. A good force:

* Has resources at its disposal
* Has goals it is pursuing
* Has some form of membership or allegiance for those that aid it

Political organizations, trade guilds, military organizations, religious
organizations, and community organizations tend to be good forces. At times
certain powerful individuals, like an ancient dragon plotting beneath a
mountain, can be forces of their own.

The player characters may suggest forces for the GM to add through their
allegiances, bonds, or other aspects of their character. The initial goal
provided by the GM may also suggest forces at play.

Each force is described by a name, area, goal, resources, plots, opportunities,
and moves.

* Name is what you call it.
* Area describes the physical domains in which the force has influence. Define
  the area when creating the force, you can change it later as needed.
* Goal is what the force is pursuing. Much like player goals they can range in
  scope and duration, but they should always be a concrete outcome. Write one
  to start with. If that goal is achieved or abandoned replace it with a new
  one or discard the force.
* Resources are the people, objects, connections, and information the force has
  at its disposal. List 2-3 to start with, then add and remove them during play
  to reflect actions that the players undertake or as the result of GM moves.
* Plots are the activities the force is currently pursuing to further its goal.
  They do not have to be complicated or clandestine, they can be as simple and
  direct as rebuilding a barn or attacking a stronghold. If the force is added
  as part of a goal or adventure location make sure it has at least one plot
  related to that. You can add new plots at any time.
* Opportunities are open weaknesses or offered deals that the players can take
  advantage of, defend, or accept. Add them as appropriate during play.
* Moves are GM moves representing common actions the force takes. Start with
  any that come to mind and add more between sessions to reflect how the force
  operates.

Forces stay on your tracking sheet until they either lose their purpose (no
longer having a goal), are soundly defeated, or lose relevancy to the current
action of the game.

Forces are used when planning adventure locations and reviewing the GM log to
create more adventures for the player characters and keep the world in motion.

## The GM Log

During each session you'll keep a GM log. The goals of your GM log are to:

* Keep you focused on the game in the moment
* Provide a reference of what happened
* Identify elements to use in planning for future sessions

Your log is made up of entries. Your entries should be as brief as possible,
just enough to remind you of important bits. A sentence or less most of the
time, maybe 3 sentences at most.

There are three types of entries, each indicated by it's own symbol:

* Events, indicated with a dot ·, describe something significant that happened.
* Notes, indicated with a dash -, are ideas or observations that come up during
  the game.
* Futures, indicated with a forward point >, are unresolved threads that may
  lead to new goals, adversaries, and threats.

During each session take notes as they happen. Don't worry about capturing
everything or writing in a way that will make sense to anyone else. These are
your notes to help you plan for the future.

Between sessions review your log from the previous session. Look for:

* Things that benefit forces in play
  * Add new resources to those forces to reflect them
* Things that might drive a force to action
  * Add new plots for those actions
* Things that present opportunities to forces or player characters
  * For opportunities for the player characters, add them as opportunities on
    the force they would impact
  * For opportunities for forces, add plots to exploit them
* Important, useful, or dangerous locations the players might want to explore
  * Add these as adventure locations
