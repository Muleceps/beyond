# Introduction

The world is broken but that’s not the problem. A magical mishap collided the
world with its own past, future, and a few parallel realities. A wizard’s tower
sits atop a nuclear reactor drawing on that power the same way it had drawn on
the ley lines. Giant eagles take to pirating from their new floating roost
aboard an aircraft carrier. Dinosaurs fight for food with owlbears.

Those aren’t really problems, though. People returned to life easily enough,
adapting as people always do. Turns out being a car mechanic isn’t all that
different from repairing magical automatons. The problem is that people have
taken advantage of the upheaval to revel in their greed, power, and gluttony.
It’s the same problem we’ve always had, but now powered by a world in flux.

You set out into this world to do what is right, to protect those who cannot
protect themselves, to test your mettle and better yourself facing those who
would live off the work of others.

## A Fantasy Adventure Game

_Beyond_ is a fantasy adventure game drawing on a long lineage of similar
games. It aims to embrace the parts of the genre that work while also moving it
forward. You’ll need a GM and 3-5 players.

You can view this playtest version as [a web
page](http://www.latorra.org/beyond/), [PDF](/release/Beyond.pdf), or the [raw
source](https://github.com/Sagelt/beyond/). You can send feedback to me [on
twitter](https://twitter.com/olde_fortran) or by [filing an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/Sagelt/beyond/issues/new/choose).

Oh, and the name _Beyond_ is probably a placeholder. Or maybe not. Who knows.

### Versioning

Each release of Beyond has a version number of the form xx.yy.zzzzzzzz. The xx
part is the major version. A new major version indicates a milestone in
development. We're currently on major version 0. Major version 1 will probably
be about the point the game is ready for public playtesting. Major version 2
would probably be some kind of funded release.

The yy portion is the minor version. Minor versions differ from each other in
ways that are significant enough that you may have to update characters, choose
different moves, etc. You don't necessarily have to migrate between each minor
version, you can jump ahead several at a time, but you'll need to take some
time to review the character classes in particular. Each minor version gets
release notes mentioning significant changes.

The zzzzzzzz portion is the build. Each build differs in mostly editing:
rewordings, clarifications, typo corrections. A build may also add new moves or
classes but it won't alter existing moves, classes, or mechanics in an
incompatible way. You should be able to move between builds for the same minor
version on the fly.

## The World of Beyond

This is a world of collisions. Magic, technology, and myth all live side by
side.

The dominant mode of the world is fantasy. The general shape of the world is
that of a fantasy realm with dragons and dungeons, ruins and rust monsters,
otyughs and owlbears.

Bits, pieces, and people of modern Earth are common. A knight might ride a
motorcycle instead of a charger, a wizard might keep their spells on a cell
phone, an accountant might now be a cleric, &etc. It turns out adding modern
technology to a fantasy realm doesn't change all that much: electric lights are
just as convenient as a rock with _light_ cast on it.

Larger transplants from modern Earth, like a few city blocks, a movie theater,
or an entire town, are frequent. Most everyone knows of at least one such
intrusion within their local area. In these areas the scenery flips somewhat:
instead of bits and pieces and modernity in a fantasy realm it's small elements
of fantasy on a modern city street.

In all cases modern technology continues to work, but it works as magic instead
of as technology. Sure, there's no reliable electricity, but somehow the winds
of magic drive enough electrons around to keep things functioning (most of the
time). There may not be gasoline for that pickup truck, but it turns out troll
spit is just as flammable. In general any modern technology works as the same
concept, but against a different world: a cell phone app might actually collect
stray thoughts instead of posts, while a movie screen becomes an actual portal
to another realm. Honor the metaphor of what technology does over the details
of how you get AA batteries in a dragon's lair.

Technology is not so uniform as it was in modernity, though. Since it acts
according to the idea of what it is each cell phone might be a little
different: a spellbook for a wizard, a direct line to the gods for a cleric. A
few special items have come through as artifacts, behaving far beyond what
normal items can.

Less commonly other ages of Earth have collided. There's a known bit of the
Western Front still fighting at the edge of a pastoral county. Some far future
technology is said to have manifested deep in a mountain range.

Rarest of all, elements of other fictions are known to have crossed over.
Telamonian Ajax is a noted adventurer, most recently having quested into the
Castle of the Flaming Skull to find a portal said to reside there.

Despite all of this, life continues. The actual intrusions are rather settled
and normal. They are more like going to another country than going to another
world. People live their lives as they always have. Some transplants yearn for
home, but in the same way you might yearn for old friends after moving to a new
place. This is a world that is garish and colorful with odd congruences
everywhere.

The problems are what they always are when things change: the greedy, powerful,
and hateful have used this opportunity to further their own agendas. Nature has
been tampered with and harmed. People and places have been exploited by those
who do not care.

The player characters are those who would set to solve problems, to help the
helpless, to build stength from discord. They set out with spell, prayer,
blade, and song to test themselves against the powerful and unjust. Some
adventure because it is right, some adventure because it is hard, but all will
find a world that is not short on dangerous places and powerful enemies.

## Quick Start Guide From Dungeon World

_Beyond_ is based on _Dungeon World_, but it isn’t a new edition of that game.
It considerably shifts the mechanics, procedures, and setting. Since this is a
playtest and is incomplete this section helps fill in the game:  you can just
assume this is _Dungeon World_ except that…

* There are no stats. Each move has its own bonus which advances on its own.
* Rolling a 6- doesn’t grant XP. Instead it grants advancement towards
  abilities on that specific move.
* There are no debilities. Instead there are conditions on each move. Each
  works differently.
* There can be multiple player characters of each class.
* There is no end of session move. Instead each class has its own XP
  instructions for end of session.
* There are no moves for being an elf, dwarf, or whatever sentient creature.
  Being an elf, dwarf, or human is just your form, noted on your character
  sheet.
* The core moves are called adventurer moves and each class has their own copy
  of them. The base moves are the same, but each class has different abilities
  and conditions for them.
* Bonds are now rolled randomly. Each bond can be used three times (once to
  gain a reserve die, once to improve a roll, and once to downgrade a roll)
  then it is resolved. Resolved bonds grant XP _or_ special bond moves.
* Each character has reserve dice. Reserve dice can be added to any roll. If a
  reserve die is added to a roll you add the number rolled on the reserve die
  to the total. When you have time to rest and recover you roll all your
  remaining reserve dice and gain HP equal to the total (up to your max), then
  refill your reserve dice to your starting amount.
* Alignment is replaced by allegiance. Allegiance can be to a big concept, like
  Good, or to a specific group, entity, or ideal.
* All the player characters share a goal. The first goal is provided by the GM
  to kick off the game. Once that goal is completed the party writes a new one,
  but they have to agree on it. The goal is what unites this group of people
  beyond their direct bonds to one another.
* NPCs are represented by a single die indicating their strength in the
  current situation. Their damage is equal to that die, their HP is equal to
  the number of sides on that die, and their armor is equal to the number of
  sides divided by 4 (round down).
* The GM's structure is no longer Fronts.
* The world is a more specific kind of fantasy, a collision of worlds and ages.
* Hirelings, steadings, and many of the more narrow special moves are gone.

Other than that, some bits of _Dungeon World_ (or in some cases _Apocalypse
World_) remain the same:

* Rolls are 2d6. On a 7+ the move says what happens. On a 6- the GM says what
  happens (and you probably won't like it) unless the move specifically calls
  out otherwise.
* Damage is specified by class, not by weapon
* You have HP. You lose it when you take damage. If you get to 0 you take your
  last breath.

## Getting Started

Each player chooses a class. The currently available classes are:

* [The Cleric](#the-cleric)
* [The Fighter](#the-fighter)
* [The Thief](#the-thief)
* [The Wizard](#the-wizard)

The GM provides a starting Goal for the party, then opens the adventure at a
key moment in pursuing that goal.
