# Mystic Patron

You have the patronage of a mystical entity. You gain the Patron, Dark Bargain,
Desperate Plea, and Bane moves. You may also replace any of your current bonds
with bonds to your patron.

## Patron

You have a connection to an entity connected to one of the fundamental forces
of magic. Note their name (as best you know it, maybe Palmon, The Queen of
Tears, or Fists-of-Stars) and choose one for each:

* Name: _____________
* Sign
  * A dimming of lights
  * Insects and rodents
  * An inaudible rumble
  * A scent of spice
* Manifestation
  * A shadow
  * A whispering book
  * An apparition
  * A reflection
* Seeming
  * Glum and gloomy
  * Cold
  * Aristocratic
  * Cruel and uncaring
  * Joyous
* Interest
  * Mortal memories
  * Souls
  * Reshaping the world
  * Sacrifices
* Powers
  * Shadows
  * Creatures of the dark
  * Flames
  * Frost

## Dark Bargain

When you tell your patron what you want and make it known you will pay the GM
will name a cost for each that is true:

* The request is not in your patron's interest
* The request is hard to accomplish with their powers
* Your patron is happy with you

Potential costs include:

* Retrieving something of value
* Destroying an obstacle
* Spreading the sign of your patron
* Causing embarassment to their enemies

## Desparate Plea

When you look to your arcane patron in a moment of need, roll+bonds with your
patron. On a 10+ their agenda aligns with yours for the moment: some
manifestation of their power will remove you from danger, at least for the
moment. On a 7-9 you are still too useful to lose, but there is a cost: they
will preserve you, but hold 1 over you. Expect them to claim something that is
yours at the worst time. So long as they have hold over you, they will not
answer another desperate plea.

## Bane

When you channel your patron's power into a blast roll+bonds with your patron.
On a hit you deal 1d6 damage or hinder the target giving +1 forward to you or
an ally acting against them. On a 7-9 you consume something of value to you (1
HP, 1 supply, 1 XP, 1 advancement).
