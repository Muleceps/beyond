# Spellbook

When you gain a spellbook you get the Prepare Spells and Cast A Spell moves.
Your spellbook starts with 3 1st level spells and all the cantrips.

## Prepare Spells

When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet contemplation of
your spellbook, you:

* Lose any spells you already have prepared.
* Prepare new spells of your choice from your spellbook whose total levels
  don’t exceed your own level+1.
* Prepare your cantrips which never count against your limit.

## Cast A Spell

When you release a spell you’ve prepared, roll+2. On a 10+, the spell is
successfully cast and you do not forget the spell—you may cast it again later.
On a 7-9, the spell is cast, but choose one:

* You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you
  how.
* The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast—take -1 ongoing to
  cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.
* After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell again
  until you prepare spells.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a
penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

**Abilities**

* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Trial And Error: Gain a new spell of your level or lower,
  then erase all advancement from this ability.
* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Master Caster: +1
* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Empower Magic: On a 10+ you have the option of choosing from
  the 7-9 list. If you do, you may maximize the spell's effects or double its
  targets.

**Conditions**

* < > Leaky Mind: On a hit you always forget the spell, in addition to any
  other choice you have to make.

## Cantrips

### Light

An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as bright as a torch. It
gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel, but it is otherwise like a
mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame. The spell
lasts as long as it is in your presence.

### Unseen Servant
You conjure a simple invisible construct that can do nothing but carry items.
It can carry anything you could carry with one arm. It cannot pick up items on
its own and can only carry those you give to it. Items carried by an unseen
servant appear to float in the air a few paces behind you. An unseen servant
that takes damage or leaves your presence is immediately dispelled, dropping
any items it carried. Otherwise the unseen servant serves you until you end
the spell.

### Prestidigitation

You perform minor tricks of true magic. If you touch an item as part of the
casting you can make cosmetic changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool it, warm
it, flavor it, or change its color. If you cast the spell without touching an
item you can instead create minor illusions no bigger than yourself.
Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly illusions—they won’t fool
anyone, but they might entertain them.

## 1st Level

### Contact Spirits

Name the spirit you wish to contact (or leave it to the GM). You pull that
creature through the planes, just close enough to speak to you. It is bound to
answer any one question you ask to the best of its ability.

### Detect Magic

One of your senses is briefly attuned to magic. The GM will tell you what here
is magical.

### Telepathy

You form a telepathic bond with a single person you touch, enabling you to
converse with that person through your thoughts. You can only have one
telepathic bond at a time.

### Invisibility

Touch an ally: nobody can see them. They’re invisible! The spell persists
until the target attacks or you dismiss the effect. While the spell is ongoing
you can’t cast a spell.

### Magic Missile

Projectiles of pure magic spring from your fingers. Deal 2d4 damage to one
target.

### Alarm

Walk a wide circle as you cast this spell. Until you prepare spells again your
magic will alert you if a creature crosses that circle. Even if you are
asleep, the spell will shake you from your slumber.
